        <h1>Practical Layouts with CSS Grid</h1>
        <p><em>The best way to learn something new is to practice.</em> When I started learning CSS Grid, I found that most of the articles/tutorials provide a very basic layout to make it easy to explain things. But those easy layouts do not cover real word challenges that we face while working on actual projects. So I decided to design some real pages to find out the real challenges while working with new CSS layout modules.</p>
        <p>I am creating these pages using CSS Grid layout Module, Flexible Box Layout Module (Flexbox), and other new features in CSS. Also, I have shared my code in this <a href="https://github.com/hsrtech/practical-layouts-with-grid" target="_blank">github repository</a> so that anybody can use the code for learning.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <ul class="faq">
          <li><strong>Can I use these designs?</strong>
            I have used some open source designs available at different websites; due credit is given to each designer. Please get in touch with the respective designers if you need more details about licensing information for a design. 
          </li>
          <li><strong>Can I use this code?</strong>
            This is an open source project, you can use the code as you like. However because code in this project is experimental, I cannot guarantee its compatibility with all browsers and devices.
