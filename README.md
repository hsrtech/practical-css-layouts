# Practical CSS Layouts

**Project Homepage:** http://jaspreetkaur.com/practicalcsslayouts/

*The best way to learn something new is to practice.* When I started learning CSS Grid, I found that most of the articles/tutorials provide a very basic layout to make it easy to explain things. But those easy layouts do not cover real word challenges that we face while working on actual projects. So I decided to design some real pages to find out the real challenges while working with new CSS layout modules.

I am creating these pages using CSS Grid layout Module, Flexible Box Layout Module (Flexbox), and other new features in CSS. Also, I have shared my code in this github repository so that anybody can use the code for learning.
